# nbgitpuller Link Generator WebExtension

A browser extension to help you generate [nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/)
links directly from GitHub.

## What does this do?

On the GitHub page for files, folders and repositories, it adds an
'nbgitpuller' button.

On clicking this, you can enter a JupyterHub URL and the application
you want to use to open this file, folder or repository. Then you
can just copy the nbgitpuller URL, and share it with your students!

The JupyterHub URL and application you choose are remembered, so
you do not need to enter it over and over again.
